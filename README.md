# Flex Panels image gallery with CSS and Vanilla JavaScript


This is my solution to the JavaScript30 "Flex Panels Image Gallery" Challenge created by Wes Bos. I decided to try it myself after watching the video that Wes Bos made and added an extra code for when one panel opens the other sibling panel closes.
